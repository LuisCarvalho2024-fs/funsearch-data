# FunSearch

This repository is a "manual" fork from the FunSearch repo, adapted to run new funsearch experiments with datasets. 
All changes were made locally and then sent to this repository at once.

This project is meant to run on jupyter notebooks or colab, though the setup for colab might be different.
The requirements are not listed, but it's mostly PANDAS, NUMPY, itertools, sklearn, collections and the openai libraries.

Any LLM can be used, you just have to adjust accordingly on the Evaluator.
